# SimplaTex

A prototype program that aims to help users write PDF/Latex documents by using premade sections/templates.    


## Installation

Works on Linux as well as Windows

Download the `.jar` file and run using `java -jar path-to-SimplaTex.jar`
    
## Info

When run, a folder named `SimplaTex` will be created in your `Documents` folder. It will contain the `.pdf`, `.tex` and `.log` files.

If the document is not created when the `Create PDF` button is pressed, take a look at the `.log`.

## FAQ

#### Why stop at a prototype ?
Concept is interesting and could be very usefull, sadly the interface doesn't do the job for more than 2 page documents.

#### What should be changed

- Interface : the user interface isn't fit for this program. More space should be added for the sections. View only one editor at a time. 

- Templates : sections should (probably?) contain more information to declutter the UI.
